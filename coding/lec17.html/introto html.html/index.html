   <p>I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social and information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>

<h2>Book and Teaching </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Since Spring 2021, <a href="https://www.karen-levy.net/">Karen Levy</a>  and I have been teaching a course entitled  <a href="https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs1340/2024sp/">Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340)</a>. The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled <a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/info2040_2017fa/">Networks</a> . The book, like the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.</li>
